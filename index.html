        <p>Here is how we will spot how the Difference works in two pictures in a Ghost Game!</p>  
        You’ll have two pictures that look almost the same but what you don't know is that there are a few sneaky differences hiding in there. Your job is to carefully examizie the both pictures and find those differences. They could be anything like a missing object,a moved object or even a small detail that’s been altered. Once you spot a difference, you can point it out. The challenge is to find all the differences before time runs out I will give you 5 seconds to analyze the picture.But look carfully some objects are in the same place but alternated.How I said it’s a super fun game that tests your observation skills. Give it a try and see how many differences you can find.
